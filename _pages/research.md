The brain, with its billions of neurons interconnected in complex ways, constitutes a high-dimensional, multi-scale, nonlinear dynamical system of immense combinatorial complexity. Despite my efforts to develop or discover effective mathematical theories to describe its function, this remains a profound intellectual challenge for both myself and the entire research field.

Broadly speaking, my goal is to leverage mathematics to comprehend the computational processes of the brain and ultimately bestow intelligence upon machines, essentially creating AI inspired by the brain. Specifically, I am intrigued by the construction of mathematical theories aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying brain activity across multiple scales ,  from the intricacies of single neurons to the dynamics of neuronal networks. Additionally, I am focused on developing statistical methodologies to extract insights from experimental data and proposing theoretical frameworks for the computations performed in various brain regions.

During my master's studies, my primary focus was on applying generative learning methods to characterize brain activity. Specifically, I introduced the powerful generative model of Variational Autoencoders, capable of learning effective representations of cortical activity from data and featuring unsupervised learning. Experiments conducted as part of my work, using a large dataset of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project for training, demonstrated that Variational Autoencoders can learn the underlying structure of the data and represent it as a set of latent variables. These latent variables not only characterize patterns of brain activity but also generate new samples of brain activity, potentially aiding in a deeper exploration of the underlying patterns and mechanisms of brain activity.

During my masterâ€™s studies, I also had the opportunity to visit and collaborate with researchers at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). The laboratory I visited was jointly led by a Principal Investigator (PI) from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology and SUSTech. During my time in this laboratory, my main focus was on exploring the properties of mammalian place cells. In this research, we recorded hippocampal dorsal CA1 neurons of four mice running in a virtual environment. We found that individual neurons exhibited multi-scale and multi-dimensional representations, whereas previous studies suggested that single place cells typically only have one or two place fields in a small environment. Throughout this process, I completed the entire workflow of data collection and analysis.

I am confident that the upcoming summer school will prove to be a source of abundant theoretical and speculative inspiration, offering me fresh perspectives ranging from cellular mechanisms to dynamic models of brain networks. In particular, luminaries such as Memming Park and Songting Li hold the potential to illuminate novel aspects of brain dynamics, while experts like Xiao-Jing Wang can deepen my comprehension of neuronal model mechanisms. Moreover, Robert Yang's expertise promises valuable insights into neural networks. Undoubtedly, the participation of other distinguished scholars in the summer school will contribute additional dimensions to my research. Therefore, I am eagerly anticipating this highly enriching summer course.
