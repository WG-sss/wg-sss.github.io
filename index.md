# Biography
&#129303;Hi! I am currently a M.S. student at Beijing Normal University, advised by [Prof. Bailu Si](https://sss.bnu.edu.cn/yjszsztw/bssds/sbl/index.htm).

# Research Interests

Broadly speaking, my research goal and interest is to leverage mathematics and modern AI to comprehend the computational processes of the brain, and if possiable bestow intelligence upon machines, which means creating Brain-inspired AI. 
Specifically, during my master's study advised by Prof.Si, I have learned how to consruct a mathematics model defining Place Cell and Grid Cell.
Additionally, I am focused on developing a Deep Net to extract insights from high-throughput biomedical data like fMRI for get the insight of how brain activity evovled. 

My research points focu on ðŸ¤”:
* Computational model of neuron.
* Generative AI.
* Brain computer interface.
