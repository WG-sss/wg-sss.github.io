I posted this question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78432707/when-slurm-starts-executing-a-task-it-still-takes-a-long-time-for-the-task-to-a), hoping to find a solution to this annoying problem. Unfortunately, I didn't receive a satisfactory answer.

After reaching out to the cluster administrator for assistance, I gained some valuable insights into this issue.

By using the `python -h` command, I discovered the `-u` parameter:

```
-u     : force the stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered;
         this option has no effect on stdin; also PYTHONUNBUFFERED=x
```

When printing messages using the `print()` function in Python, there is a caching mechanism. Setting the `-u` parameter when submitting a Python task forces the messages to be printed immediately.

Although this seemed like a potential solution, my testing revealed that it did not effectively resolved this issue.

This issue remains as frustrating as mentioned earlier, and in the end, I wasn't able to solve this problem. It seems that resolving this issue would require delving deeply into the underlying working of cluster OS and SLURM. However, I don't have the time or energy to thoroughly investigate this minor but persistent issue.
